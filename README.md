Hello there! We are team George Washington Carver, and our project will be looking at Food Demand in Guatemala. 
For context of our team's code and presentation overall, Guatemala is a country in Central America, and shares its border with the south of Mexico. It has high rates of climate related disasters and deeply divided socioeconomic classes, where poverty and wealth are concentrated in 8 different regions: Metropolitana, Noroccidente, Nororiente, Norte, Peten, Suroccidente, and Suroriente. This translates to **Metropolitan, Northwest, Northeast, North, Peten, Southwest, and Southeast. **

As a result, a large portion of Guatemala faces malnutrition and food insecurity. 
Therefore, our project seeks to assess how these constraints of budget in Guatemala affect food demand for various types of food and corresponding price elasticities for those foods. Additionally, the nutritional contents of various foods ranging from luxury goods to staples is something we wanted to explore.

We hope you are find the contents of food demand in Guatemala in our code interesting!
